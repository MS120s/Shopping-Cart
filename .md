1. When using relative url always start them with a "../"
  -----------------------------------------------------
2. In other to export and import js documents each Js script type in the html need to be set to module. For example (<script src="" type="module"> </script>)
  -----------------------------------------------------
3. to change objects into arrays we use the Object. method. For exmaple:
numberEmail = {
    "00": "sindre@scrimba.com",
    "01": "per@scrimba.com",
    "02": "frode@scrimba.com"
}

You'll use methods like 
- **Object.values(numberEmail)**   This puts just the values in an array.
- **Object.keys(numberEmail)**  This puts just the object keys in an array.
- **Object.entries(numberEmails)** This put each entry into a sub-array keeps them all in one array.
